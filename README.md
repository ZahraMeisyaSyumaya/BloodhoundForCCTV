# Bloodhound - Object Detection and Tracking System
Bloodhound is a Python application that utilizes YOLOv8 for object detection and tracking in video files. The application identifies specified classes, tracks their movements, and logs relevant information such as direction and timestamp. Bloodhound provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy configuration and interaction.

# Enhanced Analysis for 'person' Class
Bloodhound provides more effective analysis through log system filtering focused on the 'person' class. This allows users to identify clothing colors and track the motion direction of the monitored target. The filtering within the log system is tailored to enhance identification and tracking specifically for the 'person' class. Users can leverage this feature to perform more targeted and efficient analyses based on clothing color identification and tracked motion direction.
